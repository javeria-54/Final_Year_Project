# Vector Register File 

## Description

- Vector Resgister File (VRF) contains a set of vector registers (e.g., V0, V1, V2, ..., Vn) capable of holding vector elements. Each register can store multiple data elements, depending on the vector length (VLEN).

## Features

- The vector register file consist of **32 VLEN** bit vector registers.
- The granularity of the vector register file can be changed by tunnig the **LMUL** parameter
- V0 register is used as the  mask register . It is can't be written except when the mask_wr_en is 1 to update the mask value . Its length is VLEN.

## Important Terminologies 

- ###  VLEN
    - VLEN defines the total number of elements in a vector register that a vector instruction operates on. It represents the entire length of the vector to be processed.It is a implementation dependent parameter and indicates the number of bits of a single vector register.

- ### LMUL 
    - LMUL defines how many elements are processed per lane by multiplying the number of elements processed in each lane. It scales the number of vector elements assigned to the lanes for parallel processing.It is possible to tune the parameter LMUL to chage the granularity of the ***VRF*** e.g  setting ***LMUL*** to **2** means VRF will composed of  **16** ***"2 x VLEN"*** bit vector registers.

## Block Diagram 
The block digram of the vector register file in case of **LMUL = 1** as a result of which VRF consisting of **32 VLEN** bit vector registers and when **LMUL = 2** consisting of **16**  registers each having **2 x VLEN** bits.       

- ### LMUL = 1

# Getting Started



## Installation of Vivado  

Install [Vivado](https://github.com/ALI11-2000/Vivado-Installation) and [Verilator](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html). Follow the instructions provided in the corresponding links to build these tools.

## Build Model and Run Simulation

To build Signed Combinational Multiplier, use the provided Makefile. Follow the steps below for simulation using Verilator or Vivado.

### Simulation with Verilator
Run the following command to simulate using Verilator:

```markdown
  make verilator
```


To view the waveform generated by Verilator, execute:

```markdown
make ver_waves
 ```
### Simulation with Vivado
For simulation on vivado run the following command:

```markdown
make 
```

The waves on vivado will be created that can be viewed by running

```markdown
make viv_waves
``` 
### Simulation with Vsim
For simulation on vsim run the following command:

```markdown
make vsim
```

The waves on modelsim will be created that can be viewed by running

```markdown
make vsim_simulate
```
